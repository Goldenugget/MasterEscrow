# MasterEscrow
Escrow Contract Generator - HoldMeHostageâ„¢ Agreements

# WIP
Deploys a constructor for escrow smart contracts. These smart contracts allow a party to stake their promise to send an asset and/or perform actions with any sum of ETH collateral, only releasable by their counterparty.

Among other benefits and use cases, this automated escrow function can help parties better transact online with less need for trust and/or agents at a distance, and is an extension of https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.3.2/solidity-by-example.html#safe-remote-purchase.

For example, by calling the Master Contract, an online seller can stake their promise to mail an item with a similar value of ETH (or whatever else may be negotiated to effect the transaction), fully returned by purchaser when the item is actually delivered.
