# MasterEscrow
Escrow Contract Generator - HoldMeHostageâ„¢ Agreements

# WIP
Deploys a constructor for simple escrow smart contracts that hold sellers/promisors to their end of bargain. 
For example, by calling the Master Contract, a seller can stake their promise to transfer an asset with ETH collateral, only releasable by purchaser when they receive the asset. 
Among other benefits and use cases, this automated escrow function can help parties better transact online with less need for trust and/or agents at a distance, and is an extension of https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.3.2/solidity-by-example.html#safe-remote-purchase.
