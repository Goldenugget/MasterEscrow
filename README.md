# MasterEscrow
Escrow Contract Generator - HoldMeHostageâ„¢ Agreements

# WIP
Deploys a constructor for escrow smart contracts controlled by counterparty. Chiefly, these smart contracts allow a party to stake any amount of ETH on their promise to do or send a thing -- only releasable by their promisee counterparty ("HoldMeHostage"). 

Among other benefits and use cases, this automated escrow function can help parties better transact online with less need for trust and/or agents at a distance, and is an extension of https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.3.2/solidity-by-example.html#safe-remote-purchase.  

For example, by calling MasterContract, an online seller can create a personal escrow account to stake their promise to mail an item with a similar value of ETH (or whatever else may be negotiated to effect the transaction), fully returnable by purchaser when the item is actually delivered and the transaction completes. 

As WIP, the current iteration of MasterEscrow still poses certain counterparty and security risks:

*Third-party can freeze ETH collateral to extract payoff before a promisee accepts and takes control of ETH. 
Clearly, this is less than ideal for large value transactions. There is some degree of safety, however, in the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions and the relatively low monetary incentive to freeze a stranger's collateral (cannot seize for yourself, can only freeze or return to sender). Be that as it may, there is room for improvement. 

*Note: This third-party threat is effectively neutralized in uni-lateral contract situations (e.g., Ebay) where promisee acceptance of standing offer immediately create privity and right to control. 

*In more negotiated situations, such as an Asset Purchase Agreement, this threat can be also be substantially reduced by making contract execution itself call the create escrow and acceptance functions on MasterEscrow, putting the promisee in control of collateral upon signing.

In progress:
* Reduce promisee counterparty risks -- require promisee match promisor returnable stake for good faith through entire transaction?
* Allow promisee to either (i) return or (ii) seize ETH collateral after receiving promised benefit (currently, can only *return*).
* Allow promisor to assign collateral to specific Ethereum address on creating new escrow contract (close window on third-party risks).
